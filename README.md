# 🧪 MLOps Learning Sandbox

Welcome to my digital lab! 🚀

This repository serves as a **playground** for my transition into AI Engineering and MLOps. Here, I document my daily coding practice, test new frameworks, and break things to learn how to fix them.

### 📚 What's inside?
- **Python:** Algorithms, data structures, and scripting practice.
- **Docker:** Containerization experiments.
- **Kubernetes:** Manifests, cluster configurations, and CKA exam prep.
- **ML/AI:** Scikit-learn basics and model training scripts.

### ⚠️ Note
*This code is for educational purposes. For production-ready projects, please check my pinned repositories.*
